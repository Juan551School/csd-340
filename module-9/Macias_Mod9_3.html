        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p class="intro">
            Hello, my name is Juan Macias Vasquez and my academic <span id="journey">_________</span> has been great in Bellevue.
            I loved taking classes her specially compared to my last school.
            I live with my <span id="family">_________</span>, that includes my father, mother, two sisters, and there are three cats in my house.
            I have my own cat named and each of my sisters have their own cat but my cat and my youngest sister’s cat don’t get along.
        </p>

        <p>
            I love <span id="learning">_________</span> about new technology mainly that focus on video games.
            I liked seeing how I can connect the things I learned in class to things I use a lot like having code reading a file is how video games load save data
            or having different types of code interact with each other even by just reading the other one’s file.
            For this project it has the option of using JavaScript and I haven’t use it before only Python, currently learning Java, and very little C++
            but I hope to learn more about JavaScript and how to use it.
        </p>

        <p>
            What excites me most about this class is learning new things link connecting web pages together
            Technology is always evolving, and I enjoy keeping up with new skills.
            I look forward to using these skills in my future classes and building <span id="future">_________</span> carrier in programming.
