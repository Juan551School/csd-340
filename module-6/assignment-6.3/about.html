                    Jasmine Went to Boston College to study becoming a nurse practitioner. She chose this school due to the full ride scholarship she got even though it was far from home and she would feel home sick every now and then. The first school she went to was out of state in Massachusetts but is now studying at a Redrock’s community college to do some credits before transferring to another University to complete the master’s degree.
